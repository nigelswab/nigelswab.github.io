<p>High-speed video is an integral part of prosthetic heart valve durability
testing, especially given the updates in 
<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77033.html" target="_blank">ISO 5840-1:2021</a> 
that place greater emphasis on leaflet kinematics. As such, 
one of my responsibilities while on co-op at 
<a href="https://vivitrolabs.com/" target="_blank">Vivitro Labs</a> 
was to design and specify a high-speed camera system for a new Accelerated 
Wear Tester (AWT) that could be efficiently transferred between testing units 
with consistent valve framing and image quality. By the end of my co-op term, 
I had specified a lens for aortic valves, designed and tested multiple 
camera mounting and lighting prototypes, and refined camera and 
light mounting designs. Although done in parallel, this project can 
be broken into two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera System</strong> - encompasses the specification of a lens 
and the design of mounting for an 
<a href="https://www.aostechnologies.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDFs/Process_Monitoring/AOS_Promon_U1000_en_2017_web.PDF" target="_blank">AOS PROMON U1000</a>
high-speed video camera. <strong>
<a href="Work Term 4 Final Report - Camera Mount Design.pdf" target="_blank">(Full report on camera mounting here)</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Lighting System</strong> - includes the specification and layout
of LEDs, collaboration on a PCB, and the design of mounting.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Medical devices can be vital to treating patients with 
cardiovascular disease; any failure can have life-altering 
consequences. Vivitro Labs is a company dedicated to reducing the risk 
to patients by developing cardiovascular device testing equipment, 
offering laboratory testing, and providing consulting services.
While working at Vivitro as a Mechanical Engineering Co-op, my time 
was primarily spent contributing to the development of a new prosthetic 
heart valve durability tester.</p>
<h2 id="prosthetic-heart-valve-durability-testing">Prosthetic Heart Valve Durability Testing</h2>
<p>
<div class="row justify-content-center">


<div class="col-9 align-self-start">

Durability testing is one of the most inherently expensive and time-consuming 
processes of heart valve development. Testing must adhere to ISO 5840 and 17025
testing standards and demonstrate that prosthetics will remain functional for 
200-400 million cycles under specific operational conditions. The use of 
Accelerated Wear Testers (AWT&rsquo;s) reduces the time and cost of these tests.</p>
<p>Although Vivitro currently sells an AWT, the HiCycle, design limitations
and advances in the market have led them to begin developing a new AWT 
with cycling speeds 300-2100 BPM, or 5-35 Hz. While capable of higher speeds, 
cycle frequency is often limited by the valve; at least 95% of the cycles must
have defined pressure differentials consistent with normotensive conditions for
at least 5% of the cycle&rsquo;s duration, and leaflet kinematics must be 
consistent with those observed in the hydrodynamic assessment.

High-speed video is an important part of durability testing; footage of 
the heart valve must be regularly compared to footage taken in more 
physiologically accurate conditions when tuning an AWT, inspecting for 
damage, and observing the effects of wear. Therefore, providing a quick, consistent, and painless way to set up 
and record high-speed video on the new AWT was an important part of 
producing a compelling value proposition and positive user experience.

</ul>

<h1 id="the-designs">The Designs</h1>
<p>After defining the design objectives and constraints, I created concept 
models using Solidworks while specifying a suitable lens for aortic valves.
Since Vivitro also runs a testing lab, I was able to gain valuable 
feedback and insight from end users throughout the design process.</p>

Several factors related to the camera, camera mounting, and prosthetic

specialize in one of aortic or mitral valves, it was decided that a 
separate lens would be specified for each valve.</li>

<p>To confirm that the camera lens, focusing rack, and lighting were 
collectively capable of capturing the full range of aortic valve 
sizes, a test marker was designed and 3D printed with the largest and
smallest expected diameters and depths of prosthetic aortic valves. As can

the camera mounting system provides sufficient adjustability to capture the 
full range of aortic valves.</p>

also tested. Given time constraints, I was unable to quantify the amplitude of
vibrations captured in high-speed video. Therefore, qualitative notes
were taken and summarized below. All configurations failed to provide adequate

<p>As can be seen above, while PCB temperatures remained low enough to avoid 
damaging the acetyl mounts, they still rose fairly high. However, 
the light output tested is rarely required for even high-speed video capture, 
thus it is unlikely that the peak temperatures seen will even be approached 
in normal operation. Nonetheless, it was advised that a timer be programmed to
turn off the lights when operating at high output for over 10-15 minutes
to reduce the risk of a fire or AWT damage.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-and-recommendations">Conclusion and Recommendations</h1>
<p>Following the testing of the camera and lighting systems, along with 
the first AWT prototype, I worked with another engineer to introduce 
several modifications to the design of all three. The major changes to
the camera and light mounting are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updates to the design of the AWT significantly reduced the required
camera mounting rod length, improving image stability.
<ul>
<li>This also meant that the same camera mounting prototype could be 
used to test camera stability.</li>
<li>The 18 mm rod variant of Concept 2 was chosen and its mounting 
location on the AWT was centered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It was decided that each AWT testing unit will come with a dedicated 
light, so the Concept 3 (chamber mounted) design was refined.
<ul>
<li>Updates to the AWT&rsquo;s valve chamber allowed the light ring mount to be 
simplified to a ring with three locating nubs and a flat.</li>
<li>Black acetyl was chosen in response to the amount of light that bled 
through the white acetyl prototypes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the last week of my co-op, we successfully submitted drawings to a 
manufacturer to be made over the holiday break. Additionally, before leaving, 
I calculated and suggested a target spring rate for vibration isolating feet 
to reduce the amplitude of vibrations observed by the AWT when in operation, 
especially at 22 Hz.</p>
