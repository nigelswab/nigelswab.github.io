<p>During the Spring semester of 2021, four mechanical engineering 
students and I partnered with 
<a href="https://bluerobotics.com">
Blue Robotics</a> , for our capstone project. This project encompassed 
the development of the first prototype of a seafloor imaging towfish 
that Blue Robotics has continued developing into a marketable product.
Despite logistical complications caused by COVID-19, the team managed to 
build and test three prototypes in 98 days. The final prototype, the 
<em>BlueFish</em>, met the client&rsquo;s requirements, though several areas of 
improvement and refinement were identified.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-lg-7">

Towfish are becoming more common in the hobby, science, and industrial
communities and are used for many purposes, including pipeline monitoring, 
seafloor exploration or mapping, water quality monitoring, national defence,
and more. Mounting a camera or imaging sonar to a towfish, as done in this 
project, improves image quality over a vessel mounted system since 
towfish are unaffected by waves on the surface. Adding depth and altitude 
control to the towfish further increases stability and image quality while
enabling varying degrees of resolution. Currently, towfish with dynamic depth 
control do not exist on the market and alternatives are not affordable.

Several objectives were identified early in the project and given 
varying weights of importance after consulting with our client, 
Blue Robotics. Some of these objectives included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depth control - ± 0.25 m</li>
<li>Response Frequency - &lt; 0.5 Hz</li>
<li>Pitch Control - ±3°</li>
<li>Roll Control - ±3°</li>
<li>Altitude - 1-10 m from the sea/lake floor</li>
<li>Depth rating - 100 m</li>
<li>Bill of Materials - $320-$400 (USD)</li>

<p>Early in the project, one of my primary responsibilities was the specification of 
the electrical components and their interfaces. It was decided that for the purposes of
this project, it would be best to use an Arduino Uno for the control logic of the 
BlueFish while data logging and communication to the BlueBoat or laptop would
be done through a Raspberry Pi 3b+. Several sensors, lights, and actuators were also 
specified, many of which were designed and made by Blue Robotics. Collectively, this 
assembly was referred to as the <em>FishGuts</em></p>

<p>Next, an electronics tray was designed and manufactured before assembling into the
final BlueFish prototype. Several smaller components, such as the voltage converter,
were not included in the CAD modal, but were allocated space during the design process,
along with wire routing. As can be seen, the final assembly required tight packaging.</p>

<p>Lastly, I designed a GUI with PyQT5 so that users may communicate with 
the BlueFish and monitor data readings live. This was also made so that 
our group could quickly modify PID settings when testing and tuning 
the device. However, time constraints and a limitation of the python 
plotting library used prevented me from completing a working version
of the live plotting feature. Nonetheless, the GUI worked well and 
allowed us to update the PID settings and retrieve data without having
to extract the Blue Fish.</p>

Upon finding this out during a test run, it was decided that live plotting was not enough of a priority to spend time refactoring this feature's code.</p>

Throughout the project, several experiments were done to test everything 
from the hydrodynamic stability to individual sensor validation. For major
milestone tests, such as hydrodynamic testing, waterproof validation tests, 
and depth control tests, we created the

<p>Although we intended to do more testing and PID tuning with the final
assembly, logistical problems delayed the completion of the last 
BlueFish build and the availability of testing equipment. That being said, 
from preliminary testing, results look promising. The following videos show 
dry testing of the tilt correction and a wet test of the final BlueFish 
prototype.

<p>As shown above, final testing unfortunately only took place off of a 
dock, rather than with a boat. We were thus unable to get the BlueFish 
into a steady-state mode for extended periods of time. However, 
the graphs below show that in the brief steady-state conditions that
were observable (~7-20 seconds elapsed time), the BlueFish was relatively 
stable given how little PID tuning done during testing.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">With a target depth of 0.5 meters below surface level, it can be seen that the BlueFish successfully dives from 0.3 m and retains an error of about ±0.1 m in depth. Given this was done with no PID tuning, this result was promising given the potential room for improvement with more control system development.</p>

The observed offset was theorized to be due to the method of towing the BlueFish from the edge of a dock, introducing a slight roll moment. However, without tuning the PID, the BlueFish still manages to obtain the ±3° of roll targeted in the objectives (neglecting the offset).</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-and-recommendations">Conclusion and Recommendations</h1>
<p>Overall, the project was successful in creating a functional BlueFish 
prototype, along with documentation of its design, analysis, and testing. 
It was also found that the prototype met the client&rsquo;s requirements. However, 
testing showed that there is plenty of room for further refinement of the
mechatronic system and mechanical designs. Nonetheless, our team completed an 
initial prototype that was deemed worthy of continued development towards a 
marketable product.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>While early results were promising, much more testing needs to be done on
the BlueFish, especially at more representative depths while being towed 
by a boat. However, several areas of improvement were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3D printed nosecone and tail designs need to be modified to a split
design suitable for vacuum casting.
<ul>
<li>With this split, mounting of several components, like the lights and camera,
can be significantly simplified.</li>
<li>Collectively, these changes will lower the final bill of materials cost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Arduino could be replaced by a Pixhawk flight controller to better
integrate with the rest of Blue Robotics' existing software and development 
architecture.</li>
<li>Significant work should be done to tune the PID settings of the BlueFish as
we were unable to spend time doing so during testing.</li>
<li>The implementation of live data plotting should be modified to run in the 
main thread of the BlueCommand GUI.</li>
<li>Camera integration needs to be finished to create photomosaics of the seafloor.</li>
<li>The BlueCommand software still presents some bugs which need to be corrected,
along with some small quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>
